        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It helps in organizing code, improving reusability, and modeling real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and can access the properties and methods defined in its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation binds data and methods together and restricts direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with __.\n",
        "Example: __init__, __str__, __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent class), promoting code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows the same method name to perform different actions based on the object or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public members\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected members (_variable)\n",
        "\n",
        "Private members (__variable)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method __init__() that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object’s data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class methods and static methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class method uses @classmethod and takes cls as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static method uses @staticmethod and does not take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python supports it using default arguments, not directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute while still providing controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism improves flexibility, code reusability, and allows writing generic and extensible code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods. It is created using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Better security\n",
        "\n",
        "Easy maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Difference between class variable and instance variable\n",
        "\n",
        "Class variable is shared among all objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ → user-friendly string representation\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__ → developer-oriented detailed representation\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Significance of super() function\n",
        "\n",
        "super() is used to call methods of the parent class from the child class, especially constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Significance of __del__ method\n",
        "\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is destroyed or deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod does not access class or instance data\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod accesses class-level data using cls\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism with inheritance occurs when a child class overrides a method of its parent class. When the same method is called using a parent class reference, Python decides at runtime which method to execute based on the object type (dynamic binding).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example idea:\n",
        "A parent class defines a method show().\n",
        "A child class overrides show().\n",
        "Calling show() on a child object executes the child’s version.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. This is achieved by having each method return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example idea:\n",
        "obj.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "This improves code readability and conciseness.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When an object is followed by parentheses (), Python internally calls the __call__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "Makes objects behave like functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Used in decorators and callable objects"
